synopsis: "Helpers for incremental operations on map like data structures"
description: "
A set of functions for operating incrementally and efficiently on map
like data structures.  This leverages new functionality in Incremental
along with the ability to efficiently diff map data structures using
=Map.symmetric_diff=.
