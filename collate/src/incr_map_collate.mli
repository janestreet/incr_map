(** Perform filtering, sorting and restricting to ranges.

    The [Collate.t Incr.t] contains the parameters for filtering and sorting, and
    ranges. It can be updated incrementally, but note that filtering & sorting isn't
    really incremental on filter & order since we [bind] to these.

    For sorting & filtering, technically all this function should need is a compare
    function and a filtering predicate. However, the interface is slightly different: we
    require users to provide ['filter] and ['order] opaque types in [Collate.t], and
    ways to convert them to predicate & compare here.

    It is done this way for better interaction with [Incr]. We belive that most users
    would have such types, being simple algebraic data types, anyways. You can always
    set e.g. [filter_to_predicate=Fn.id], and just pass the functions directly, but be
    prepared to explore the fascinating world of functions' physical equality. *)

(** A function for finding the index into the collated map of a particular key.
    The resulting index is "pre-range-restriction", which means that even if
    the key is not in the collation range, [key_rank] can still respond with
    its index. However, the index is after filtering and ordering, which means
    that if it is filtered out of the map (or isn't in the original map), then
    the result will be [None]. *)

module With_caching : sig
  (** A version of [collate] with caching.

      We use [Incr_memoize] to cache incremental nodes for the result of a particular:

      - [order],
      - [(order, filter)], and
      - [(order, filter, range_bucket)]

      so that even if the [Collate.t Incr.t] changes, as long as it changes back before
      the result is evicted from the cache, we can resume a cached incremental
      computation instead of discarding it and computing it from scratch.

      Note that if an earlier incremental node is evicted from its cache, its children
      in subsequent caches are no longer used. This is to ensure we don't duplicate
      computations from building later nodes on top of semantically identical but
      physically distinct earlier nodes.

      For example, if the [order] cache is LRU with size 2, and [order_filter_range] is
      LRU with size 10, you could get 10 cached final values if they only use two
      distinct orderings, but if they were to each have a distinct ordering, only two
      will be usable. *)
